# GitHub Pages Portfolio Re-direct

This repository contains a simple re-direct setup that automatically forwards visitors from the main GitHub Pages URL to the portfolio section of the website.

## How it works

The repository uses a combination of HTML meta refresh and JavaScript to ensure reliable re-direction:

1. When visitors land on the main page, they are automatically re-directed to the `/portfolio` section
2. The re-direct is implemented using:
   - HTML meta refresh tag
   - JavaScript window.location re-direct
   - A fallback link for manual navigation

This setup ensures that visitors will be re-directed regardless of their browser settings or JavaScript availability.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an entry point to my portfolio website, ensuring that visitors are automatically directed to the most relevant content.
